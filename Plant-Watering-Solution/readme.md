The project is based on Internet of Things (IoT) which helps in monitoring the water level, air quality
and soil moisture content with the help of APIs. The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects
(or groups of such objects) that are embedded with sensors, processing ability, software, and other
technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other
communications networks. An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and
tools for building software applications. Basically, an API specifies how software components should
interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components. A
good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then
puts the blocks together. A monitoring system is software that helps system administrators monitor their
infrastructure. These tools monitor system devices, traffic, and applications, and sound the alarm in the
event of malfunctions and disruptions. There are lots of monitoring systems on the market, from
freeware to professional software. Monitoring the level of water in water reservoirs with the help of
ultrasonic sensor and moisture content of soil using soil moisture sensor, the data is gathered and
produced to the Wi-Fi module NodeMCU ESP8266 which allows to update the information on the
Thingspeak website which displays the information. Open Weather Map collects the information of air
quality and also the projected weather of the next week. The OA website helps in obtaining all the
information of Air quality, water and soil moisture levels on a single platform. This project helps in
many ways like tracking the water level without physically being there, This helps a lot of physically
challenged people and old and weak people. Automation of such thing is already there but for area with
water scarcity monitoring is best option rather than automation for utilization of resources wisely and
efficiently.
